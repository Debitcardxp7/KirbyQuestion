Hello! I am Devin Martinez and I am a computer science major who is pursuing their bachelors at Missouri Valley College. I am profficient in Python, C++, JavaScript, HTML, as well as SQL.
I have been studying computer science for over 2 years and have experience teaching and instructing the youth. I hope this small program can provide a bit of insight to my knowledge and
personality, as well as a bit of laughter to your day!
