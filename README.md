Hello! I am Devin Martinez and I am a computer science major who is pursuing their bachelors at Missouri Valley College. I am profficient in Python, with experience working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C++, and java. This was my very first project using frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I came up with this around Christmas time, with wanting to learn about these languages, but wanting to make a funny and simple little project to begin my journey in educating myself in FrontEnd development. I had a relatively easy and quick time learning HTML and CSS, easily creating the simple designs I wanted and learning how the language works. As for JavaScript, I struggled a bit with learning the syntax, as I was still learning about certain libraries in Python such as PyTorch and MatLibPlot. Learning these at the same time made it a bit challenging to fully grasp the syntax quickly, which was where I learned to focus on a given task individually, rather than dip my hands in multiple pots at a time.
